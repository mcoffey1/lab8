Conways's Game of Life
Rules found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
The program is designed to run in two possible modes: interactive and batch. 
The mode chosen will be determined by how the program is run:

1) interactive mode: this mode will be triggered when the program is executed with no command line arguments
Initially, the program should set up a completely blank board; it should then ask the user for input:

If the user enters:

a : ask for coordinates where to add a new live cell (no action needed if cell is already alive).
r : ask for coordinates where a cell should be removed (no action needed if cell is already dead).
n : advance the simulation to the next iteration by applying the rules of the game.
q : quit the program.
p : play the game continuously (forever, without asking for more input; you can press control-C to stop the program).

2) batch mode: this mode will be triggered if the executable is followed by a data file.
The data file will consist of a sequence of commands (see above) followed by a "p". Lines starting with an "a" or an "r" will be followed by two numbers (representing a cell's location). A typical data file (scene) will mostly have "a" lines, ending with a "p" line. 
In this batch mode, the program will play the scene continuously. 
You may assume that all data files will have a "p" as the last line; iow, that all scene files are always valid and correct.

The scenes in the Life directory contain some interesting patterns as examples and can be run using batch mode
